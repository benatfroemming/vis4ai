# Visualizing Reinforcement Learning

This repository is part of my final project in CSCI 8615 VIS4AI. In this web app we visualize a discrete state environment called 'Cliff Walk' which we solve using Q-Learning, and a continuous state environment called 'Cart Pole' which we solve with Deep Q-Learning.
